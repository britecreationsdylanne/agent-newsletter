CURIOUS CLAIMS

A Case of Bad Gasoline Leaves Drivers Running on Empty

Earlier this month, hundreds of drivers in Colorado found themselves stalled after unknowingly pumping their cars full of contaminated gasoline. A number of gas stations, including King Soopers and Costco locations, had received unleaded fuel supplies from distributor Sinclair that were accidentally mixed with diesel fuel.

According to Kelly Blue Book, diesel can ruin a car's engine by affecting fuel injectors, filters, pumps, and even the exhaust system in some cases, which can lead to a car completely stalling or not starting as a result.

The state has, so far, received more than 200 complaints from consumers, with some citing repair costs of $3,000 or more. But will it be covered by insurance? According to PropertyCasualty360, it depends. "If something happens that causes you to incur property damage, which is what we're talking about here, then that could potentially be covered by the policy, because it was something external that caused the damage to the car," said one source quoted by the outlet.
```

AGENT ADVANTAGE

Caution Ahead: 4 Tips for Insuring Student Drivers

Every year, a new class of student drivers hit the road, and insurers have a brand new set of clients to add to many existing family policies. But there are some things to keep in mind and inform policyholders about before successfully merging into this new territory. Here are four key tips to communicate to clients, courtesy of PropertyCasualty360.

1. **It's going to be expensive.** Teen drivers are the most expensive to protect, for obvious reasons. According to the article, 16-year-olds cost about $7,600 a year to insure. However, the price does go down in the succeeding years, reduced to $5,600 for 19-year-olds.

2. **Male drivers present extra risks.** Teen boys will be the most expensive to insure because the risk of aggressive driving and driving under the influence is statistically greater.

3. **Location matters.** Like adult drivers, insuring teens will cost more based on the state in which they live. The highest rates have been found in Louisiana while the lowest are in North Carolina.

4. **Know the opportunities for discounts.** Teens with good grades and good driving histories can get reduced rates. Also, if the student driver is learning in a car fully owned by the family, it's wise to advise policyholders that liability-only coverage is sufficient.

## Recurring Themes & Messaging

### The Homeowners Insurance Crisis
This is a **central recurring theme**. Key talking points:
- Rising premiums (cite specific percentages)
- Non-renewals and coverage availability
- Climate/weather impacts
- Regional variations (Florida, California, Midwest)
- Consumer anxiety and shopping behavior
- Agent opportunity to educate clients

**Always tie back to BriteCo's value prop:**
> "BriteCo jewelry policies do not report claims to CLUE or A-Plus. So your clients don't have to worry that a claim will impact their premium or risk a non-renewal."

### Agent as Trusted Advisor
Position agents as essential guides for clients navigating complexity:
- "Agents must clarify the distinction between..."
- "This moment of market stress is one of opportunity and obligation..."
- "Agents who stay at the forefront of... will best serve their clients"
- "Communication with clients is key at this time"

### BriteCo Value Proposition
When promoting BriteCo products:
- Emphasize client protection (not just agent revenue)
- Lead with the problem (HO crisis) before the solution
- Use specific numbers (4,500+ agents, 20-40% savings)
- Keep the hard sell to Brite Spot section

## Humanizing the Writing: Avoiding AI Tells

This section is critical for making content feel authentic and written by a real person rather than generated by AI.

### Common AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Overused Transitional Phrases
AI tends to rely on the same transitions repeatedly. Avoid or limit:

| Avoid/Limit | Use Instead |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Additionally" | Just start the next point |
| "Furthermore" | "And," "Also," or nothing |
| "It's worth noting that" | Just state the fact |
| "It's important to understand" | Delete—let the content speak |
| "In today's [industry/world]" | Be specific about what changed |
| "Navigating the [X] landscape" | "Dealing with [X]" or be specific |
| "At the end of the day" | Cut entirely |
| "Moving forward" | "Next," "Going forward," or cut |
| "In this regard" | Cut entirely |
| "Leverage" (as a verb) | "Use," "take advantage of" |

#### 2. Empty Intensifiers
AI loves meaningless amplifiers. Cut these:
- "Very" (almost always unnecessary)
- "Extremely"
- "Incredibly"
- "Highly"
- "Significantly" (unless citing actual significance)
- "Robust" (especially "robust solution")
- "Comprehensive" (overused)
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Innovative" (show, don't tell)
- "Seamless" / "Seamlessly"

**Instead:** Let the facts speak. If something is significant, the numbers will show it.

#### 3. Hollow Opening Phrases
Never start sentences with:
- "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- "As we all know..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "Needless to say..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "In terms of..."
- "The fact of the matter is..."

**Instead:** Start with the actual subject or action.

#### 4. Vague Generalizations
AI often hedges or generalizes. Be specific:

| AI-Style (Vague) | Human-Style (Specific) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "Many homeowners are affected" | "47% of homeowners saw rate increases" |
| "In recent years" | "Since 2023" or "Over the past two years" |
| "A significant number of" | "More than 200" or "Nearly a third of" |
| "Various factors contribute to" | Name the actual factors |
| "This can lead to issues" | "This causes [specific problem]" |

#### 5. Overly Balanced/Diplomatic Language
AI tries to please everyone. The BriteCo Brief has a point of view:

**Too AI:**
> "While there are certainly challenges in the current market, there are also opportunities for agents who are willing to adapt their approach."

**More Human:**
> "The market is brutal right now—but agents who reach out to clients before renewal season are winning business from competitors who wait."

### Sentence-Level Authenticity

#### Vary Your Sentence Openers
AI often starts sentences the same way. Mix it up:

**Monotonous (AI pattern):**
> "Agents should review policies annually. Agents should also communicate changes early. Agents can use CRM tools to track renewals."

**Varied (Human pattern):**
> "Review policies annually. When changes come, communicate them early—before clients hear from someone else. A good CRM can help you stay ahead of renewal dates."

#### Use Contractions
The newsletter uses contractions naturally. They make writing feel conversational:
- "it's" not "it is"
- "don't" not "do not"
- "you'll" not "you will"
- "we're" not "we are"
- "that's" not "that is"
- "won't" not "will not"

**Exception:** Formal quotes from sources may use full forms.

#### Allow Sentence Fragments
Used sparingly, fragments add punch and rhythm:
- "The result? A 27% rate hike."
- "Not surprising."
- "Here's why."
- "But will it be covered by insurance? According to PropertyCasualty360, it depends."

#### Embrace the Dash
The em dash (—) adds energy and informality:
> "The state has, so far, received more than 200 complaints from consumers, with some citing repair costs of $3,000 or more. But will it be covered by insurance? According to PropertyCasualty360, it depends."

> "There's a scenario here where homeownership becomes an unsustainable feature of the American economy—and it won't just be in Florida or California."

### Vocabulary & Word Choice

#### Industry-Specific Language
Use terms agents actually use:
- "book of business" (not "client portfolio")
- "write quotes" (not "generate proposals")
- "HO rider" or "floater" (not "homeowners policy endorsement")
- "getting appointed" (not "becoming authorized")
- "non-renewal" (not "policy termination")
- "premium increase" (not "rate adjustment")

#### Avoid Corporate-Speak
| Corporate | Human |
|-----------|-------|
| "Solution" | "Tool," "option," "way" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Implement" | "Start," "launch," "do" |
| "Optimize" | "Improve" |
| "Synergy" | Never use this |
| "Stakeholders" | "Clients," "partners," "people involved" |
| "Best practices" | "What works" or just give the advice |
| "Actionable insights" | "Tips," "advice," "what to do" |

#### Power Verbs from Actual Newsletters
These verbs appear naturally in the source material:
- "hit" (rates hit new highs)
- "drop" / "dropped" (coverage dropped)
- "surge" / "soar" (premiums soaring)
- "wreak havoc"
- "loom" (as the crisis looms)
- "spike" (claims spike)
- "stall" (car stalled)
- "kick up" (kick up premiums)
- "erode" (erode confidence)

### Rhythm & Flow

#### The Rule of Three
Lists of three feel natural and complete:
> "Market conditions, regulatory changes, and technology adoption are creating both challenges and opportunities."

> "...from tapping into home warranties to forgoing homeownership altogether in order to plan for retirement."

#### Short-Long-Short Pattern
Vary paragraph and sentence lengths for rhythm:

> "Here's a stark fact. The Hartford conducted a survey that found that 'just 4% of millennials see insurance as an appealing industry,' says Carrier Management. To combat this, agencies must focus on attracting younger professionals."

(Short statement. Longer supporting detail. Medium call to action.)

#### End Strong
The last sentence of a paragraph should land with impact, not trail off:

**Weak ending:**
> "These are some things agents might want to consider going forward as they think about their approach."

**Strong ending:**
> "Doing so will be crucial in strengthening trust and safeguarding long-term relationships with clients."

### Personality Markers

#### Conversational Asides
The newsletter occasionally speaks directly to the reader with parenthetical thoughts:
> "Teen drivers are the most expensive to protect, for obvious reasons."
> "...(and it's very expensive to renew)..."
> "...which can lead to a car completely stalling or not starting as a result."

#### Rhetorical Questions
Used sparingly to engage readers:
> "But will it be covered by insurance?"
> "Why the change?"
> "But believing they offer the same level of protection is causing some issues."

#### Pop Culture & Wordplay (Curious Claims Headlines)
The Curious Claims section is where personality shines most:
- Movie references: "It Ends With Us, Says Insurance Provider..."
- Idioms twisted: "It Was Raining Cats & Dogs (Sort Of)"
- Puns: "Tips the Scales," "Running on Empty," "Goes Up in Smoke"

#### Expressions That Feel Human
These natural phrases appear in the newsletters:
- "It's hard to believe..."
- "Here's what you need to know..."
- "The twist?"
- "Not surprising..."
- "In fact..."
- "That said..."
- "The reality is..."
- "Bottom line:"
- "For one thing..."

### Authenticity Through Specificity

#### Name Names
Real publications, real people, real places:
> "Melissa Schlarb traversed Route 74 near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park"
> "Clay Wadsworth of PolicyWatch Agency, Round Rock, Texas"
> "a $50,000 diamond ring that mysteriously vanished during a magic show"

#### Cite Real Sources Naturally
Weave sources into sentences rather than adding them as afterthoughts:

**AI-style:**
> "Insurance premiums are rising. (Source: PropertyCasualty360)"

**Human-style:**
> "According to PropertyCasualty360, 'insurance premiums [rose] 8.7% faster than the average rate of inflation in 2025.'"

#### Include Telling Details
Small, specific details make stories feel real:
> "The driver thankfully escaped injury, but her windshield—not so much."
> "For a one-time fee of $20 ($5 more if you want a paper certificate)..."
> "St. Lawrence Agency will pay $1 a year … for 10 million years."

**Human-Edited (After):**
> **Property & Casualty Premiums** Will Rise 7% on Average By the End of 2025, with Much of the Share Tied to Increased Rates for Homes and Autos

**What Changed:** Specific percentage, specific timeframe, specific cause. No vague "landscape" or "various factors."

---

### Example 2: Intro Paragraph

**AI-Generated (Before):**
> Welcome to this month's edition of The BriteCo Brief. In this issue, we will be exploring various important topics that are relevant to insurance professionals in today's ever-changing market environment. We hope you find the following information valuable as you navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.

**Human-Edited (After):**
> It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since Hurricane Katrina caused one of the biggest catastrophes in US history and had an astronomical impact on insurance. We look at how the industry is better prepared today, provide tips on retaining small business customers, and examine the curious world of alien abduction insurance.

**What Changed:** Specific hook (Katrina anniversary), concrete topics teased, personality ("curious world of alien abduction insurance"), no generic filler.

### Example 3: Curious Claims Opening

**AI-Generated (Before):**
> In an interesting development in the insurance world, a unique claim has emerged that showcases the diverse and sometimes unexpected nature of insurance cases. This particular incident involves a situation that many would find quite unusual.

**Human-Edited (After):**
> A driver in western North Carolina recently got the surprise of her life when she found a surprise guest in her passenger seat. As Melissa Schlarb traversed Route 74 near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in November, a dead cat came crashing through her windshield. It was the work of a bald eagle flying overhead that either lost its grip or discarded its kill.

### Example 4: InsurNews Spotlight Analysis

**AI-Generated (Before):**
> The current state of homeowners insurance is characterized by various challenges that are impacting consumers and industry professionals alike. Multiple factors are contributing to this situation, including climate-related events, economic conditions, and regulatory changes. It is important for agents to understand these dynamics in order to effectively serve their clients.

**Human-Edited (After):**
> The wild swings we saw in homeowners insurance and home market prices in 2025 are not slowing down any time soon. New reports have surfaced that show the drastic measures some property owners are going to in order to find alternatives for protection, from tapping into home warranties to forgoing homeownership altogether in order to plan for retirement.

**What Changed:** Active verbs ("wild swings," "not slowing down"), specific examples, shows rather than tells ("drastic measures... from tapping into home warranties to forgoing homeownership").

---

### Example 5: Agent Advantage Tip

**AI-Generated (Before):**
> **Maintain Regular Communication.** It is important for agents to maintain regular communication with their clients throughout the policy period. This helps to build relationships and ensure that clients are aware of any changes that may affect their coverage.

**Human-Edited (After):**
> **Schedule Annual Reviews.** Don't wait for renewal time. Proactive mid-year check-ins show clients you're invested in their protection year-round.

**What Changed:** Shorter, punchier, uses contraction ("Don't"), specific timing advice, focuses on benefit to client relationship.
